Desktop-only React + Vite control plane for Big Plump Bird.

## Commands

- `bun run dev` - start Vite dev server
- `bun run build` - typecheck + production build
- `bun run preview` - preview production build
- `bun run lint` - run repository Biome checks from workspace root

## Notes

- Linting/formatting is handled by Biome at the repository root.
